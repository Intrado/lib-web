In the event that SchoolMessenger in its sole discretion determines that any unscheduled maintenance is necessary, SchoolMessenger will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Customer. In the event that SchoolMessenger fails to meet agreed service levels, Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy will be a service credit to Customer’s account equal in value to any requested services not meeting the terms of said Customer’s agreement. Any credit is expressly conditioned upon Customer providing SchoolMessenger written notice of such failure sent to <a href="mailto:billing@schoolmessenger.com">billing@schoolmessenger.com</a> by the tenth calendar day following such service level failure.</p>

<p><b>8.4. Non-Infringement Warranty. </b>SchoolMessenger warrants that it is the sole owner and has full power and authority to grant the license and use of the Service and other rights granted by the Agreement to Customer with respect to the Service and that neither the performance by Customer in its utilization of the Service, nor the license of and authorized use by Customer of the Service as described herein will in any way constitute an infringement or other violation of any copyright, trade secret, trademark, patent, invention, proprietary information, non-disclosure, or other rights of any third party. </p>

<p><b>8.5. Other Warranty. </b>SchoolMessenger warrants that the Service shall be free of viruses, Trojan horses, worms, spyware, or other malicious code or components<b>. </b></p>

CUSTOMER ASSUMES ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR DETERMINING WHETHER THE SERVICE IS SUFFICIENT FOR CUSTOMER’S PURPOSES.</p>

<p><b>10.Limitations Of Liability. </b>CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE CONSIDERATION WHICH SCHOOLMESSENGER IS CHARGING HEREUNDER DOES NOT INCLUDE CONSIDERATION FOR ASSUMPTION BY SCHOOLMESSENGER OF THE RISK OF CUSTOMER’S INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO ANYONE FOR INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES OF ANY TYPE OR KIND (INCLUDING LOSS OF CUSTOMER DATA, REVENUE, PROFITS, USE OR OTHER ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE), ARISING FROM BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT, OR NEGLIGENCE, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING FROM OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT. The maximum liability of either party to any person, firm or corporation whatsoever arising out of or in the connection with any license, use or other employment of the Service, whether such liability arises from any claim based on breach or repudiation of contract, breach of warranty, tort, or otherwise, shall in no case exceed the equivalent of 12 months in license fees applicable at the time of the event. The essential purpose of this provision is to limit the potential liability of the parties arising from this Agreement. The parties acknowledge that the limitations set forth in this Section are integral to the amount of consideration levied in connection with the license of the Service and that, were SchoolMessenger to assume any further liability other than as set forth herein, such consideration would of necessity be set substantially higher. Certain states and/or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitations of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the exclusions set forth above may not apply to Customer.

If the Service is held to infringe any intellectual property right, SchoolMessenger may, in its sole discretion and at its own expense, either procure a license that will protect Customer against such claim without cost to Customer or replace the Service with a non-infringing Service. Provided that SchoolMessenger complies with this Section 11.1, Customer shall have no remedy against SchoolMessenger, except it may at its option terminate the Agreement and receive a pro-rata refund of the license fees paid for under the Agreement for its use of the Service but which use has not yet been furnished by SchoolMessenger as of the date of such termination. </p>

<p><b>11.2 Customer’s Indemnity.</b>Customer shall defend and hold SchoolMessenger harmless from and against any and all Losses arising out of or in connection with a claim, suit, action, or proceeding brought by any third party against SchoolMessenger which arise out of or result from a claim by a third-party (i) alleging that the Customer Data or any Trademarks, or any use thereof, infringes the intellectual property rights or other rights, or has caused harm to a third party, or (ii) arising out of Customer’s breach of Section 5.5 and 5.12 above, provided that SchoolMessenger (a) promptly provides Customer notice of the claim, suit, action, or proceeding; (b) gives Customer sole control of the defense and related settlement negotiations; and (c) provides Customer with all reasonably available information and assistance necessary to perform Customer’s obligations under this paragraph. </p>
