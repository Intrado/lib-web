Nifty Player is a open source (MIT licensed) flash based mp3 player

The original version of niftyplayer will handle one mp3 file and can
be controlled by javascript. The original source is in version 1.7 
and can be downloaded at:
http://www.varal.org/media/niftyplayer/niftyplayer.zip

The reliance version of nifty player can handle a sequence of mp3 files
and will play them in the order listed. The modified version will need to
download all the files prior to playing them in contrast to the original version 
that will start playback as soon as enough is buffered.
From a user perspective it looks like one file is played the time shows the total
time from the first file and there is no buffering between files.
Dragging the timebar does currently not move the position of the playback
