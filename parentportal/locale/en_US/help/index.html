<h1>Welcome to Contact Manager</h1>
<p>Contact Manager will let you control what messages you receive and 
 where you receive them. Additionally, any messages which have been sent 
 to you in the last thirty days will be available for review in your Contact 
 Manager account. </p>
<p>Before you begin, make sure you have your ID number and Activation Code 
 so that you can associate your contact information with your new Contact 
 Manager account. </p>
<p>If you do not have an Activation Code and plan to activate your account 
 by phone, you will need to have your ID number and be calling from a phone 
 which is associated with your ID number.</p>
 
<h4>Activating Your Account with an Activation 
 Code</h4>

	<li class=p><p>Select the &quot;I have an Activation Code to enter 
 now&quot; option.</p></li>

	<li class=p><p>Enter your ID number and Activation Code.</p></li>
	<li class=p><p>Click the &quot;Add&quot; button. If the information 
 you entered was correct, you will receive a success message.</p></li>
