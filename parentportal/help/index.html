<p><b>Adding a Contact</b></p>
<p>To add a contact, press the "Add a Contact" button in the "Contact Preferences" page.  Once there, enter your contact's validation code and activation code.  Follow the instructions if you would like to add another contact at this moment.  Once you are done adding contacts, you will be prompted to edit their contact information.  If you want to copy one contact's information to all of your contacts, leave the "Save To All Contacts" checkbox checked.  Otherwise, you can uncheck the checkbox and edit each contact's information individually.  If a contact's information cannot be edited, it is locked by the system administrator.</p>

<p><b>Changing Your Email</b></p>
<p>To change your login email address, go to "My Account".  From there, hit the "Change Email" button and fill out the following form.  An email will be sent to your new email address for activation.  Your current email login will still be in effect until the new address is activated.</p>
