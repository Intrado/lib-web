THE WARRANTIES STATED IN SECTION 8 ABOVE ARE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE WARRANTIES OFFERED BY SCHOOLMESSENGER. THERE ARE NO OTHER WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THOSE OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

The essential purpose of this provision is to limit the potential liability of the parties arising from this Agreement. The parties acknowledge that the limitations set forth in this Section are integral to the amount of consideration levied in connection with the license of the Service and that, were SchoolMessenger to assume any further liability other than as set forth herein, such consideration would of necessity be set substantially higher. Certain states and/or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitations of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the exclusions set forth above may not apply to Customer. THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION SHALL NOT APPLY TO EITHER PARTY’S INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH IN SECTION 11 BELOW.</p>

<p><b>11.  Indemnification. </b></p

<p><b>11.1. Infringement.</b> SchoolMessenger will indemnify, defend and hold Customer harmless from and against any and all costs, liabilities, losses, and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees) (collectively, "Losses") arising out of or in connection with a claim, suit, action, or proceeding brought by any third party against Customer which arise out of or result from the infringement of any copyright, patent, trademark, or misappropriation of a trade secret relating to the Service; provided that Customer (a) promptly gives SchoolMessenger notice of the claim, suit, action, or proceeding; (b) gives SchoolMessenger sole control of the defense and related settlement negotiations; and (c) provides SchoolMessenger with all reasonably available information and assistance necessary to perform SchoolMessenger’s obligations under this paragraph. If the Service is held to infringe any intellectual property right, SchoolMessenger may, in its sole discretion and at its own expense, either procure a license that will protect Customer against such claim without cost to Customer or replace the Service with a non-infringing Service. Provided that SchoolMessenger complies with this Section 11.1, Customer shall have no remedy against SchoolMessenger, except it may at its option terminate the Agreement and receive a pro-rata refund of the license fees paid for under the Agreement for its use of the Service but which use has not yet been furnished by SchoolMessenger as of the date of such termination.</p>

<p><b>11.2 Customer’s Indemnity.</b> Customer shall defend and hold SchoolMessenger harmless from and against any and all Losses arising out of or in connection with a claim, suit, action, or proceeding brought by any third party against SchoolMessenger which arise out of or result from a claim by a third-party (i) alleging that the Customer Data or any Trademarks, or any use thereof, infringes the intellectual property rights or other rights, or has caused harm to a third party, or (ii) arising out of Customer’s breach of Section 5.5 and 5.12 above, provided that SchoolMessenger (a) promptly provides Customer notice of the claim, suit, action, or proceeding; (b) gives Customer sole control of the defense and related settlement negotiations; and (c) provides Customer with all reasonably available information and assistance necessary to perform Customer’s obligations under this paragraph.</p>

<p><b>11.3. Survival.</b> The indemnification obligations contained in this Section 11 shall survive termination of this Agreement for one year.</p>
<p><b>12. Miscellaneous.</b> In the event of an express conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of any Exhibit, the verbiage of this Agreement controls. This Agreement shall be governed in accordance with the laws of the State of California and any controlling U.S. federal law. Any disputes, actions, claims or causes of action arising out of or in connection with this Agreement (or the Service) shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in California. If any provision is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, such provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect. In the event of any litigation of any controversy or dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, its interpretations, its performance, or the like, the prevailing party shall be awarded reasonable attorneys’ fees and/or costs. Neither party shall be liable for any loss or delay resulting from any force majeure event, including, but not limited to, acts of God, fire, natural disaster, terrorism, labor stoppage, war or military hostilities, criminal acts of third parties, and any payment date or delivery of Service date shall be extended to the extent of any delay resulting from any force majeure event.
