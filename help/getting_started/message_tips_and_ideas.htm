<h1 class="whs2">Message Tips and Ideas</h1>
<p class="whs3">The success of any new communication endeavor 
 depends on how it is received by students, parents, staff and the community. 
 This section is designed to share the experience of our staff in developing 
 comprehensive <span style="margin-right: 189px;">communication strategies. 
 The following tips and ideas will help you get the most from the system.</span></p>
<p class="whs4">Tips for sending effective 
 messages:</p>
<ul type="disc" class="whs5">
	<li class=p><p class="whs3">Write your message down before 
 recording it: To create a professional sounding recording that flows smoothly, 
 always script your message first. Also, have someone else read the script 
 and give feedback before sending the message.</p></li>
	<li class=p><p class="whs6">Make your first call a 
 positive one: Rather than making your first call an absence notification, 
 start by calling all parents with a short message introducing them to 
 the messaging system. Briefly explain how it will be used to provide them 
 with relevant and timely information.</p></li>
	<li class=p><p class="whs3">Be professional, but do not 
 be afraid to have fun: Many schools have found that they <span style="margin-right: 189px;">can 
 achieve the goal of getting important information delivered while putting 
 a smile on a parent’s face. </span></p></li>
	<li class=p><p class="whs3">Always repeat important information 
 such as dates and times of events several times <span style="margin-right: 189px;">throughout 
 your message: Doing so allows recipients time to write down important 
 information.</span></p></li>
	<li class=p><p class="whs3">Start your messages by identifying 
 who you are and the reason for the message: To <span style="margin-right: 189px;">ensure 
 that recipients immediately recognize the message as coming from your 
 school or district, start each message by identifying yourself and the 
 nature of the call.</span></p></li>
	<li class=p><p class="whs3">Practice your recordings 
 until you find the most effective speaking volume: As with <span style="margin-right: 189px;">any 
 type of recording, the volume of your voice and the distance at which 
 you position the microphone affect the quality of the sound. By practicing 
 your recordings before sending messages to parents, you can find the combination 
 that works best for you.</span></p></li>
	<li class=p><p class="whs3">Do not be afraid of feedback 
 from your recipients: Ask recipients if the messages <span style="margin-right: 189px;">you 
 are sending are clear and how they could be improved. Also find out the 
 type of information recipients desire and how often they want to hear 
 from you.</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p class="whs4">Application Ideas</p>
<p class="whs3">In addition to delivering effective attendance 
 messages, you can use the system <span style="margin-right: 189px;">for 
 many types of communication between school and home. The following is 
 a list of just a few of the ways that you can put it to work for you. 
 Start by reviewing your calendar of upcoming events. Note every significant 
 event and time call outs around these dates. Be prepared to send messages 
 for any of the following:</span></p>

 this is Mr. McDonald, the principal of George Washington Middle School 
 calling to remind all of our parents and students that we begin our SAT9 
 testing on Tuesday, April 25th. The SAT9 is a standardized test taken 
 by all students in the state covering the areas of math, language, and 
 reading. It will be given on four consecutive days, taking approximately 
 two hours each morning from Tuesday through Friday. Due to the importance 
 of the test, we hope that you will make every effort to have your child 
 at school, well rested, and focused. If for some reason they cannot attend 
 on any of the days, makeup exams will be given the following week. We 
 hope that you will support your child by explaining the significance of 
 the testing and by encouraging them to put forth their best effort. If 
 you have any questions please contact the school office at 123-4567. Once

 style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Emergency Notifications:</B></span> Hello, this 
 is Mr. Williams calling all of the staff of John Hart High School with 
 an important announcement. I sincerely regret to inform you that school 
 will be canceled today as a result of the continuing snow fall. While 
 I know this comes as a tremendous disappointment to you all, please try 
 to contain your emotions so as not to wake up your neighbors. You can 
 trust me when I say that I'm as distraught about this news as you are. 
 But never fear! We have every intention of holding classes tomorrow unless 
 you hear differently from me.</p></li>
	<li class=p><p class="whs13"><span 
 style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Course Test Reminders:</B></span> Hi, this is Mrs. 
 Ruiz at San Rafael High calling to remind all of my Freshman English students 
 and their parents about this Friday's midterm exam. This test covers chapters 
 seven through twelve as well as the current events handouts. Parents, 
 you can help by reviewing the study guide questions with your child. If 
 you ask to see the guide and they say, ”r;What study guide?”, tell them 
 it's the two-sided one, on blue paper, that says Freshman English Mid-Term 
 Study Guide across the top that was handed out on Monday with five minutes 
 left in the class period. That should jog their memory! Let me end by 
 saying thank you for all the help. I truly enjoy working with all of you, 
 and I look forward to a successful midterm exam and a productive remainder 
 of the year. If you have any questions please feel free to call me at 
 (123) 456-7890, and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Good Bye.</p></li>
	<li class=p><p class="whs13"><span 
 style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Volunteer Requests:</B></span> Hello, this is Mary 
 Sanchez, the president of the Bobcat Boosters for Lincoln Elementary. 
 I'm calling to let you know about the rummage sale fund raiser planned 
 for this Saturday, May 15th starting at 9:00 am in the school parking 
 lot. We could really use volunteers to help organize donations and supervise 
 the sale starting at 8:00 am. If you are able to help for even a few hours 
 please press one, and I will contact you and get you on the schedule. 
 If you can't volunteer we would still love to see you at the sale supporting 
 your school. Thank you for your time. I look forward to seeing you Saturday.</p></li>
