<p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 12pt;">Authorizing Facebook Pages 
 for Administrators</p>
<p>Administrators may control which Facebook Pages and Walls users are 
 able to post to from the Settings subtab, found under the Admin tab. On 
 the Settings page, click on Facebook Authorized Pages. You will need to 
 be able to connect to Facebook using an account that has administrative 
 privileges for the Facebook Page you would like to authorize.</p>
<p>Additionally, you will need to manage the users who may post to the 
 authorized Facebook Page from within Facebook. As other users of this 
 system connect to Facebook through the system, they will only be able 
 to view the Pages they're authorized to post to if they are also allowed 
 to post to that Page from within Facebook. If you authorize a Page where 
 a user does not have posting privileges, it will not appear as an option 
 when the user is creating a job.</p>
<p>You may also use the Facebook Authorized Pages page to allow users to 
 post to their own Wall. This will allow users to post messages to their 
 account's Wall which will appear like any other Facebook status update. 
 </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> 
 If you do not authorize any pages, users may be able to post to any Facebook 
 Page their account has permission to post to from within Facebook.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-size: 12pt;">Connecting 
 a Facebook Account for Users</p>
<p style="font-style: normal;">You will need to allow the SchoolMessenger 
 Facebook app to have access to your account before you can post. You can 
 do this from the Account link at the top of any page or as you create 
 a job with MessageSender. You will only need to grant permission once. 
 Your permission will last until you deliberately revoke it.</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: normal;">The image 
 below shows the social media options on the Account Settings page, found 
 at the Account link in the upper right corner of any screen.</span></p>
<p style="font-style: italic;"><img src="../AccountSocialMediaOptions.gif" 
 alt="Social Media Options on the Account page." x-maintain-ratio=TRUE 
 style="border: none; width: 331px; height: 120px; float: none;
									border-style: none;" width=331 height=120 
 border=0></p>
<p style="font-style: normal;">To authorize a Facebook account, just click 
 the &quot;Connect to Facebook&quot; button. If you're already logged in, 
 the account you're logged into will be authorized for posts. If you're 
 not logged into Facebook, a window will pop up, allowing you to log in 
 and grant permission. </p>
<p style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span><span 
 style="font-style: italic;"> If you are currently logged into a Facebook 
 account, this is the account you will authenticate. If it is not the correct 
 account, please log out before you click &quot;Connect to Facebook&quot;. 
 If you've already connected to the account and it is incorrect, please 
 read the section on &quot;Changing Facebook Accounts&quot;.</span></p>
<p style="font-style: normal;">If you haven't connected to Facebook and 
 you're trying to send a job with social media options, you may also access 
 these buttons as a step in MessageSender. </p>
<p style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; font-size: 12pt;">Removing 
 a Facebook Account</p>
<p style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">To 
 remove a Facebook account, go to the Account link in the upper right corner. 
 Click on the &quot;Disconnect from Facebook&quot; button. This disconnects 
 the system from your account. To completely deauthorize our application, 
 you will need to log into your Facebook account and remove the app from 
 your Account settings on Facebook's web site.</span></p>
<p style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; font-size: 12pt;">Changing 
 Facebook Accounts</p>
<p style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">If 
 you would like to change which Facebook account you will post to, simply 
 follow the instructions to remove a Facebook account. After the account 
 is removed, you will see the &quot;Connect to Facebook&quot; button again. 
 Make sure you are logged out of the Facebook account, then click the &quot;Connect 
 to Facebook&quot; button. Just log into the correct account and grant 
 permission to post.</span></p>
