<h1>Creating Pages</h1>
<p>When you would like to share more information than will fit in the limited 
 space of social media posts, Pages are the answer. This feature lets you 
 generate a web page just like you create an HTML email. Your Page will 
 be automatically linked to your social media posts via a tiny URL.</p>
<h4>Create a Message Group</h4>
<p>To create a Page, you will need to create a Message Group and use the 
 Message Editor. You can't create a Page using MessageSender, although 
 you may use saved message groups which contain Pages from there.</p>
<ol type="1">
	<li class="p" style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"><p style="font-style: normal; 
		 font-weight: normal;">Navigate to the Message Builder by clicking 
	 the Notifications tab followed by the Messages subtab.</p></li>
	<li class="p" style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"><p style="font-style: normal; 
		 font-weight: normal;">Click &quot;Create a Message&quot; to create 
	 a new Message Group.</p></li>
	<li class="p" style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"><p style="font-style: normal; 
		 font-weight: normal;">Enter a name for your Message Group and 
	 click &quot;Next&quot; to go to the Message Editor.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>You will notice that the Message Editor consists of a grid of message 
 content types, shown below. Clicking the green plus icon next to the content 
 type will take you to a step-by-step wizard for creating content for each 
 type. Once a content type contains content for a particular language, 
 a green check will appear for that language. Each wizard contains detailed 
 Guide help to make creating content even easier.</p>

<h4><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 12pt;">Create a Page</span></h4>
<p>To create a Page, click on the green plus icon next to “Page” in the 
 Message Content grid. You’ll see an HTML editor, shown in the image below, 
 that's just like the one you would if you were making an HTML email.</p>
<p class="important"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><img src="../exclamation.png" 
															 alt="" style="border: none;" 
															 border="0" />Important:</span> 
 If you have already created a message using Microsoft Word and you want 
 to paste that message into the HTML editor, use the “Paste from Word” 
 button at the top of the editor, which looks like this: <img src="../PasteFromWord.jpg" 
	 alt="" style="border: none;" width="17" height="16" border="0" /> 
 . Messages which are copied and pasted from Word contain extra, non-standard, 
 information which may cause your message to not display correctly. Using 
 “Paste from Word” will remove most of this information. While you may 
 paste a message from Word, for best results it is better to compose your 
 message using the HTML editor if possible.</p>
<p style="font-style: italic; margin-left: 0px;"><img src="../MessageEditorPage.jpg" 
														 alt="The Page content editor" 
														 title="The Page content editor" 
														 style="border: none;" 
														 border="0" /></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px; font-style: normal;">Once you've finished creating 
 your Page, simply click &quot;Done&quot; to save your work. The tiny URL 
 link will be automatically generated and linked to your social media posts.</p>
<h4>Attachments</h4>
<p style="margin-left: 0px; font-style: normal;">If you would like to offer 
 your Page viewers files for download, such as PDFs or images, you can 
 do so using the Attachments option in the Page message editor. You simply 
 attach the files to your Page just like you would for an email and they 
 will appear in a Downloads section on your Page.</p>
<p class="important"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><img src="../light_bulb__exclamation.png" 
															 alt="" style="border: none;" 
															 border="0" /> 
 Note:</span> Restrictions on file size and number are much less severe 
 than they are for email since Pages don't need to handle the message size 
 limits typically associated with email accounts. For this reason, you 
 may find that distributing files to your recipients is better facilitated 
 by using Pages. However, please note that the Page is openly viewable 
 by anyone who can access the tiny URL, including anyone who can view your 
 social media pages.</p>
<h4>Page Media</h4>
<p>You can also embed an audio file in your Page. It can be the same as 
 the Phone content from your Message Group or something especially created 
 for your Page. Creating Page Media will cause your Page to have an audio 
 player embedded at the top, as shown in the example Page below.</p>
<p><img src="../Page.jpg" alt="An example Page." title="An example Page." 
		 style="border: none;" border="0" /></p>
<p>When you've added Page Media to your Page, the player will also be embedded 
 on Facebook, allowing viewers to listen to your audio message right from 
 your Facebook Page by simply clicking the Play button. The post to Facebook 
 will look like the following image.</p>
<p><img src="../FacebookLink.gif" alt="Example Facebook post with audio." 
		 title="Example Facebook post with audio." style="border: none;" 
		 width="400" height="152" border="0" /></p>
