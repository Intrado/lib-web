<p style="margin-right: 0px; font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><b>Course Test Reminders:</b></span> Hi, this is Mrs. Ruiz at San Rafael High calling to remind all of my Freshman English students and their parents about this Friday's midterm exam. This test covers chapters seven through twelve as well as the current events handouts. Parents, you can help by reviewing the study guide questions with your child. If you ask to see the guide and they say, ”r;What study guide?”, tell them it's the two-sided one, on blue paper, that says Freshman English Mid-Term Study Guide across the top that was handed out on Monday with five minutes left in the class period. That should jog their memory! Let me end by saying thank you for all the help. I truly enjoy working with all of you, and I look forward to a successful midterm exam and a productive remainder of the year. If you have any questions please feel free to call me at (123) 456-7890, and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Good Bye.</p>

I'm calling to let you know about the rummage sale fund raiser planned for this Saturday, May 15th starting at 9:00 am in the school parking lot.
