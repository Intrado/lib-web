<h1>Notification Summaries</h1>

<p>A Notification Summary is a report that shows you the results of any 
 active or completed job in the system. The quickest way to view a Notification 
 Summary is to click on the Report link next to the job for which you would 
 like a report. You may also access the Notification Summary for any job, 
 including archived jobs, by clicking on the Reports Tab.</p>

<p class="whs1">Accessing the Notification Summary for and 
 Active, Pending, or Completed Job</p>

<p><img src="../reportpendingjob.gif" alt="Links next to a pending job." x-maintain-ratio="TRUE" width="400px" height="31px" border="0" class="img_whs2"></p>

<p>Simply click the Report link next to the job as shown above.</p>

<p class="whs1">Accessing the Notification Summary for an 
 Archived Job</p>

<ol type="1" class="whs3">
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Click on the Reports tab. You will be taken to 
 the Report Builder as shown below.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><img src="../reportbuilder.gif" x-maintain-ratio="TRUE" width="400px" height="135px" border="0" class="img_whs4"></p>

 to select only jobs of a specific type.</p></li>
</ol>

<p class="whs1">Understanding the Notification Summary</p>

<p>The Notification Summary, shown below, is divided into four sections 
 designed to give you a quick overview of what happened with your job. 
 You may also find additional information by using the Related Links. </p>

<p><img src="../reportsnotificationsumm.gif" alt="Notification Summary" x-maintain-ratio="TRUE" width="400px" height="321px" border="0" class="img_whs6"></p>

<p class="whs1"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Related 
 Links</B></span></p>

<p>The Related Links section contains links which are also relevant to 
 your report.</p>

<p class="whs7">PDF: This link will allow you to download 
 a PDF version of the report. You will need a PDF reader, such as Adobe 
 Acrobat, to view this report.</p>

<p class="whs7">Time Distribution: This link opens a pop 
 up window that displays the report results in relation to the times that 
 the calls were sent. An example is shown below.</p>

<p class="whs7"><img src="../reportstimedistribution.gif" alt="Time Distribution Chart" x-maintain-ratio="TRUE" width="334px" height="297px" border="0" class="img_whs8"></p>

<p class="whs7">Not Contacted: This link shows a report of 
 recipients that the system was not able to contact.</p>

<p class="whs1">Filter By</p>

<p>If you used any filtering to access this report, it will be displayed 
 in this area.</p>

<p class="whs1">Summary</p>

<p class="whs1"><span style="font-weight: normal;">The Summary 
 section shows a brief overview of the job.</span></p>

<p class="whs7">Job Name: The name of the job displays here.</p>

<p class="whs7">Type: The type of job, such as Attendance 
 or Emergency, displays here.</p>

<p class="whs7">Submitted by: This area shows the name of 
 the user who submitted the job.</p>

<p class="whs7">Start Date: This is the date and time that 
 the job started running.</p>

<p class="whs7">End Date: This is the date and time that 
 the job was completed.</p>

<p class="whs7">Status: This tells whether the job is running 
 currently or completed.</p>

<p class="whs7">Ind's on List: This is the number of individuals 
 on the list or recipients.</p>

<p class="whs7"># of Phones: This is the number of phone 
 numbers that were to be contacted with this job.</p>

<p class="whs7"># of Emails: This is the number of email 
 addresses that were to be contacted with this job.</p>

<p class="whs9">Totals</p>

<p class="whs10">This section contains a breakdown of the total 
 calls sent by the job in text and graphic form.</p>

<p class="whs11"><span style="line-height: Normal;"><span 
 style="font-weight: normal;">A</span>nswered: The recipient answered the 
 phone and listened to the message.</span></p>

<p class="whs11">Machine: The recipient's 
 answering machine received the message.</p>

<p class="whs11">Busy: The recipient's 
 phone was busy.</p>

<p class="whs11">No Answer: Nobody answered 
 the phone.</p>

<p class="whs11">Disconnect: This is 
 typically a number which has been disconnected.</p>

<p class="whs12">Failed: When a message is not delivered successfully 
 and the reason for the failure is not determined to be a busy or unanswered 
 phone, the call status is set to Failed and the call is retried. A final 
 call status of Failed can be the result of a number of possible conditions. 
 For example:</p>

<ul type="disc" class="whs13">
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs12">The system attempted 
 to deliver a message to a full voice mail.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs12">The number dialed was 
 answered by an automated attendant message that was requesting some sort 
 of interaction.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs12">The call was answered 
 by an answering machine with a greeting message that lasted more than 
 45 seconds.&nbsp;</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs12"><span style="margin-left: 80px;">The 
 recipient hung up before the message started playing.</span></p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs12">The local phone company 
 switch rejected the call.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs12">The local phone company 
 switch was unable to connect the call within 45 seconds.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs12">The number is disconnected, 
 but the local phone company doesn't return standard digital disconnect 
 indicator codes.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs12">If you notice that 
 certain phone numbers consistently return failed results you should dial 
 the numbers yourself to determine what the actual cause of the problem 
 is.&nbsp;</p></li>
</ul>

<p class="whs11">Duplicate: The number 
 of recipients with duplicate phone numbers, such as siblings in different 
 grades. Unchecking the &quot;Skip duplicate phone numbers&quot; box when 
 scheduling your job will tell the system to not filter out the duplicate 
 numbers.</p>

<p class="whs11">Blocked: The number 
 of blocked phone numbers that were included in this job.</p>

<p class="whs11">No Phone #: The number 
 of recipients in your list who do not have phone numbers in the database.</p>

<p class="whs11">Not Attempted: These 
 numbers have not been called either because the system hasn't processed 
 them yet, the job's scheduled time ran out before they could be processed, 
 or the job was cancelled.</p>
