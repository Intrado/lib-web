<h1>Simple Message Templates and Ideas</h1>
<p>Sometimes the hardest part of sending a message is knowing what to say. This page contains some example messages to help you plan your script. If you haven't done so already, please review our <a title="Click to view Messaging Tips." href="Messaging_Tips.htm" onmouseover="if ((parseInt(navigator.appVersion) == 4) && (navigator.appName == 'Netscape')) ehlp_showtip(this,event,'Click to view Messaging Tips.');" onmouseout="if ((parseInt(navigator.appVersion) == 4) && (navigator.appName == 'Netscape')) ehlp_hidetip();">Messaging Tips</a> for a guide to the best practices for successful communications.</p>
<h4>Attendance</h4>
<p style="margin-right: 0px; font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Simple Message:</span> This is Mr. Price, the principal of Anytown Elementary School, calling to let you know that your child was marked absent today. Please remember to call or send a signed note explaining the reason for this absence. If you have any questions please feel free to contact Mrs. Guy, the school's attendance secretary, at (123) 456-7890. Thank you.</p>
<h4>Emergencies</h4>
<p style="margin-right: 0px; font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Snow Day School Closure:</span> Hello, this is Mr. Williams calling all of the staff of John Hart High School with an important announcement. I regret to inform you that school will be canceled today as a result of the continuing snow fall. Please expect school to resume tomorrow. In the event that the school is unable to open, we will contact you again tomorrow. Thank you.</p>
<h4>Academic</h4>
<p style="margin-right: 0px; font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Standardized Testing Reminders:</span> Hello, this is Mr. McDonald, the principal of George Washington Middle School calling to remind all of our parents and students that we begin our SAT9 testing on Tuesday, April 25th. The SAT9 is a standardized test taken by all students in the state covering the areas of math, language, and reading. It will be given on four consecutive days, taking approximately two hours each morning from Tuesday through Friday. Due to the importance of the test, we hope that you will make every effort to have your child at school, well rested, and focused. If for some reason they cannot attend on any of the days, makeup exams will be given the following week. We hope that you will support your child by explaining the significance of the testing and by encouraging them to put forth their best effort. If you have any questions please contact the school office at 123-4567. Once again, the SAT9 testing begins this Tuesday, April 25th. Thank you for your continuing support of our school program.</span></p>
<p style="margin-right: 0px; font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Course Test Reminders:</span> Hi, this is Mrs. Ruiz at San Rafael High calling to remind all of my Freshman English students and their parents about this Friday's midterm exam. This test covers chapters seven through twelve as well as the current events handouts. Parents, you can help by reviewing the study guide questions with your child. If you ask to see the guide and they say, "What study guide?", tell them it's the two-sided one, on blue paper, that says Freshman English Mid-Term Study Guide across the top that was handed out on Monday with five minutes left in the class period. That should jog their memory! Let me end by saying thank you for all the help. I truly enjoy working with all of you, and I look forward to a successful midterm exam and a productive remainder of the year. If you have any questions please feel free to call me at (123) 456-7890, and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Good Bye.</p>
<h4>Parent Involvement</h4>
<p style="margin-right: 0px; font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Volunteer Requests:</span> Hello, this is Mary Sanchez, the president of the Bobcat Boosters for Lincoln Elementary. I'm calling to let you know about the rummage sale fund raiser planned for this Saturday, May 15th starting at 9:00 am in the school parking lot. We could really use volunteers to help organize donations and supervise the sale starting at 8:00 am. If you are able to help for even a few hours please press one, and I will contact you and get you on the schedule. If you can't volunteer we would still love to see you at the sale supporting your school. Thank you for your time. I look forward to seeing you Saturday.</p>
<h4>Special Events</h4>
