An import can be configured as one of the following types:

Scheduled: Set to automatically run on certain days at a specified time

File Triggered: Set to run when it detects the presence of a specified trigger file

Manually Triggered: Runs only when an authorized user clicks the Run Now link for the import

Manual File Upload: Similar to a Manually Triggered import except that running the import will prompt the user to browse their local system for the import file each time the import is run.
